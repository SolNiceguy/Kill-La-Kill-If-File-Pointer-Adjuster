Used for adding code to files that use pointers for the game Kill La Kill If. Automtically adjusts pointers depending on how much pointer code is added. script_character file functionality has been disabled since it's still a bit buggy.   
Form1.cs has the all the code.

## Instructions
1. Drag file to "File Path" window ("Middle Offset" will automatically fill in the default value if left empty).  
2. Enter code into "Pointer Code" and "Bottom Code" windows.  
3. Apply
